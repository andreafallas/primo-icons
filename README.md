# A set of icons designed to allow easy differentiation of content item types within discovery services.

These icons were developed as a result of user experience research conducted on the Ex Libris Primo discovery service.

## What’s included

The set includes 28 rectangular icons bearing the letters A-Z and the symbols @ and &.

The icons are provided in a range of colours, and are available both PNG and SVG formats.

Three sizes of PNG are included (60x80, 120x160 and 180x240 pixels).

## Suggested use

- Use the icon featuring the first letter of the content type (e.g. ‘A’ for ‘article’, ‘B’ for ‘book’).
- Where more than one content type begins with the same letter, use the same letter icon in a noticeably different colour (N.B. be aware of colour vision deficiencies and use tools to choose an appropriate colour).
